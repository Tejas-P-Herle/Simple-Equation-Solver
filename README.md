# Simple-Equation-Solver
Solves simple equations given required variable to be solved for and minimum parameters to solve equations

The formula must be added through code using Formula class to create individual formulas

to solve for a variable run
```python
solver.solve(REQUIRED_VARIALBE, PARAM_1=VALUE_1, PARAM_2=VALUE_2, ...)
```
